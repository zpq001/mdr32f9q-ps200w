N * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
N * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
N * application code.
N *
N * xLists can only store pointers to xListItems.  Each xListItem contains a
N * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
N * descending item value order.
N *
N * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
N * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
N * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
N * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
N * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
N * the list.
N *
N * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
N * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
N * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
N * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
N * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
N * the list item itself.

N * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
N * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
N * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
N * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
N * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
N * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
N * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
N * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
N * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
N * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
N * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
N * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
N * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
N * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
N * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
N * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
N * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced

N * <pre>void vTaskDelay( portTickType xTicksToDelay );</pre>
N *
N * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the
N * task remains blocked depends on the tick rate.  The constant
N * portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
N * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
N *
N * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.
N * See the configuration section for more information.
N *
N *
N * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
N * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
N * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
N * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
N * of controlling the frequency of a cyclical task as the path taken through the
N * code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency
N * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
N * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
N * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
N * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
N * unblock.
N *
N * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that
N * the calling task should block.
N *
N * Example usage:

N * See the configuration section for more information.
N *
N * Delay a task until a specified time.  This function can be used by cyclical
N * tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.
N *
N * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
N * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
N * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
N * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
N * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
N * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
N * each time it executes].
N *
N * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
N * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
N * unblock.
N *
N * The constant portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
N * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
N *
N * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the
N * task was last unblocked.  The variable must be initialised with the current time
N * prior to its first use (see the example below).  Following this the variable is
N * automatically updated within vTaskDelayUntil ().
N *
N * @param xTimeIncrement The cycle time period.  The task will be unblocked at
N * time *pxPreviousWakeTime + xTimeIncrement.  Calling vTaskDelayUntil with the
N * same xTimeIncrement parameter value will cause the task to execute with
N * a fixed interface period.

N * functions used by tasks.
N *
N * crQUEUE_SEND_FROM_ISR() and crQUEUE_RECEIVE_FROM_ISR() can only be used to
N * pass data between a co-routine and and ISR, whereas xQueueSendFromISR() and
N * xQueueReceiveFromISR() can only be used to pass data between a task and and
N * ISR.
N *
N * crQUEUE_RECEIVE_FROM_ISR can only be called from an ISR to receive data
N * from a queue that is being used from within a co-routine (a co-routine
N * posted to the queue).
N *
N * See the co-routine section of the WEB documentation for information on
N * passing data between tasks and co-routines and between ISR's and
N * co-routines.
N *
N * @param xQueue The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.
N *
N * @param pvBuffer A pointer to a buffer into which the received item will be
N * placed.  The size of the items the queue will hold was defined when the
N * queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from the queue into
N * pvBuffer.
N *
N * @param pxCoRoutineWoken A co-routine may be blocked waiting for space to become
N * available on the queue.  If crQUEUE_RECEIVE_FROM_ISR causes such a
N * co-routine to unblock *pxCoRoutineWoken will get set to pdTRUE, otherwise
N * *pxCoRoutineWoken will remain unchanged.
N *
N * @return pdTRUE an item was successfully received from the queue, otherwise
N * pdFALSE.
N *
